    <h1><b>Thomas Lowe</b></h1>
    <p>I live in <b>Maryville, MO</b>. My favorite place to visit is my house, mostly because it is mine. It's where my favorite people live, my wife and children, and all of my really cool toys are there as well. I don't have a picture of my house readily available, so instead here is a self-portrait of my wife. Where ever she is more or less will be my favorite place.</p>
